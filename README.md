# running_count

Counter caches for Rails applications, including cached running counts.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'running_count', '~> 0.2`
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

```
class Course < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user

  keep_running_count :user
end

class User
  has_many :courses
end
```

Tracks the number of Course records associated with the User model, saving them to the `courses_count` field in the 'users' table.

Also tracks a dynamic running count in the `running_courses_count` method on the `User` model.

## Reconciling changes

```
Course.reconcile_changes
```

Will update the 'users' table with the number of associated courses in the `courses_count` field, and clear the dynamic cache.


## Development
